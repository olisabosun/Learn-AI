              <AccordionContent>
                AIHost focuses on zero-config, AI-powered automation for setup, optimization, and management, making it
                even simpler for solo founders and creators. While Vercel/Netlify are excellent platforms, we aim to
                abstract away more technical complexities with intelligent AI tools.

              <AccordionTrigger>Do I need to know coding?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                While basic coding knowledge helps for building your web app, AIHost's AI-assisted setup and GPT-powered
                control panel significantly reduce the need for deep technical expertise in hosting and infrastructure
                management.
